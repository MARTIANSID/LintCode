let the sum of subarray to be remove be y
​
total sum of subarray is equal to x lets say
​
then (x-y)mod p= xmodp -ymodp (as result wont we negetive)
xmodp=rem
ymodp=rem
​
then total remainder after removing the subarray is rem-rem=0
therefore we need to find a subarray having remainder equal to (x)mod p
